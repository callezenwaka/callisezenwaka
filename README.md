### Hi, I'm Callis 👋🏾

Glad that you came around. I am a fullstack software engineer 👨🏿‍💻 turned Program Manager, I still write codes anyway.

I also research on Privacy for Emerging Technology and Enterprise Cloud Applications.

My personal projects are centered around giving back to the community.
